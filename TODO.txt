rename :domain to :slice?

- new classes: vbd, vif

? should the module be called RubyXen ?

External commands
- check return value and throw exception if non zero
- rip all other external commands into Commands


# status = shutting down

Shutdown can take a while, during which time the status of the slice is running.
We could put the shutdown command into a queue which could be externally queried.
A background job could perform the shutdowns and update the queue. Same queuing
system could be used to create slices.

xm shutdown :slice -w # wait for shutdown to complete before returning


? how do we define an instance method that calls the class method:

	def self.shutdown(name)
	  output = `xm shutdown #{name}`
	  $? == 0 ? true : false
	end
	
	? or should that be the other way around?

'on_require' method
- Warn if not running as root
- warn if 'xm' missing
- warn if 'xen-tools' missing

Add rdoc documentation to code

Add specs

Add :dom0 => false to find commands
